Noted for her[a] distinctive singing voice,[2] she has received several accolades including three Billboard Music Awards, a Billboard Women in Music Award,[3] an American Music Award and nominations for three Grammy Awards.

His accolades include four Grammy Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 22 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, a Latin Grammy Award and nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.",

                bio: "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip-hop in Middle America and is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[3] His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has influenced many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include The Real Slim Shady, Without Me, Lose Yourself, Not Afraid, Love the Way You Lie, The Monster, Godzilla, and Houdini.",
